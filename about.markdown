<p align="left"> I hold an MPhil (Economics) and in the process of obtaining a Ph.D. (Economics), both from the University of Pretoria.

<p align="left"> My field of research focuses on understanding and investigating the role of bank regulation, particularly, (macro) prudential in influencing banking sector productivity and the eventual impact on credit extension. Motivation for my field of research stems from the fact that access to credit and responsible credit extension by banks enables economic growth and development. However, with the continued introduction and enhancements to prudential regulations with the aim of strengthening banking systems, a natural question arises as to whether prudential regulation is a hindrance to credit extension and / or access to credit, especially in emerging markets?
