  <p align="justify"> This paper investigates and estimates the macroeconomic effects of regulatory changes in the South African banking industry, by introducing narrative series capturing regulatory changes. The estimations are perfomed in a  Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR(X)) and  Local Projections-Instrumental Variables (LP-IV) settings. The results show both a contraction and increase in credit extension following regulatory changes.  </p>
