<p align="justify"> This paper presents evidence on productivity growth in theSouth African banking industry in the last 30 years. The pro-ductivity measures we construct shed light on whether thedevelopment, increased contribution and influence of thebanking industry have translated into lower cost of intermedia-tion and improved productivity and efficiency of the bankingsector. Our results show that there is no apparent trend in theunit cost of intermediation in the period 1993 to 2019, which isindicative of constant productivity.
