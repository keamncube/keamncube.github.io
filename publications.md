<p align="justify"> This paper presents evidence on productivity growth in the South African banking industry in the last 30 years. The productivity measures we construct shed light on whether the development, increased contribution and influence of the banking industry have translated into lower cost of intermediation and improved productivity and efficiency of the banking sector. Our results show three main stylized facts: (1) There is no apparent trend in bank productivity, which is indicative of constant productivity (2) Output, gross value added (GVA) and remuneration in the banking sector have grown significantly until the GFC. After 2007, remuneration and GVA have been stagnant against an increase in bank output, indicating a decline in the value of bank output, (3) Labour productivity increases significantly before the GFC but has since halved in the 10 years following the GFC when the banking industry saw a large expansion in employee numbers, not matched by a contemporaneous increase in bank output. This is partly related to the increased investment in regulatory and compliance activities to satisfy the new regulatory environment developing after the GFC.

<p align="justify"> The extension of affordable credit is key to financial inclusion but it could reduce the stability of the financial sector. Macroprudential policy, on the other hand, is designed to mitigate financial sector risk. Thus, inclusion and macroprudential regulations may be in opposition. This study estimates and contrasts the impact of these potentially contradictory regulations on the bank lending rates and volumes of South Africa’s largest banks. Our results suggest that macroprudential policy is working as intended, as it is associated with increases in interest rates on unsecured lending rates and decreases in short-term secured and mortgage lending rates. Inclusion-focused regulation is associated with increased bank lending rates in unsecured credit. We observe a decrease in the growth of unsecured lending for households and an increase in secured lending for corporates. We find that the estimated effects of financial inclusion initiatives largely overlap with – rather than offset – the estimated effects of macroprudential policy.
